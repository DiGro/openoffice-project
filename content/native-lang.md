Title: Native-Language Information

## Native Language Projects

The scope of Native Language support in Apache OpenOffice consists of:

* Hosting of native language websites on [www.openoffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/projects/native-lang.html).
Established native language "friendly" links have also established &mdash; for example, [fr.openoffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/fr/)
* Native language mailing lists (as requested and needed). The establishment of any native language mailing list requires the approval of Apache OpenOffice
PMC and typically at least two moderators. Requests for additional native language mailing lists can be
made via the [dev mailing list](mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org).
* [Native Language User Support Forums](http://forum.openoffice.org/) (for some languages).
* A [Pootle server](https://translate.apache.org/) to aid with translation.  Find more information on using Pootle in our local
[Pootle User Guide](http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Pootle_User_Guide).
<br>The  [Translation](http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html) page provides information on how to help with translation efforts.
* Many [localized web sites](http://openoffice.apache.org/website-native.html).

If you are interested is initiating (or re-starting) a native language project, please
e-mail the [localization mailing list](http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#localization-mailing-list-public).
