Apache OpenOfficeÂ® is the free and open productivity suite from the [Apache Software Foundation][0].

[Apache OpenOffice][1] features six personal productivity applications: a word processor (and its web-authoring component),
spreadsheet, presentation graphics, drawing, equation editor, and database. OpenOffice is released on Windows, Linux and
macOS, with more communities joining, including ports for FreeBSD and OS/2. OpenOffice is localized, supporting over 110
languages worldwide.

OpenOffice.org [was donated][2] to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) on June 1, 2011. As with any code base brought to
the ASF, OpenOffice.org underwent incubation before [graduating][3] to a top-level project on 2012-10-17.

A lot of good information can be found on the [Apache OpenOffice user portal][4], including a [brief history of
OpenOffice.org][5].
