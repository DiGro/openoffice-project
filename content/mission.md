##Introduction

Along with an email client and a web browser, an office suite is a core essential
application that almost every computer user requires. Although there is a dominant
 commercial product in this category, its price and limited platform and language 
support makes it an unsatisfactory option for many. OpenOffice, for over a decade,
 has helped fill this gap. Our goal is to develop, publish and support OpenOffice 
as a world-class office suite, free for anyone to use, and since it is open source,
free for anyone to build upon. Using the generally available discounted price of 
commercial office products, the value of OpenOffice downloads over the past decade
exceeds USD 10 billion (10,000,000,000).

##Overcoming the "Digital Divide"

More than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$ 2 per day, and around 
20% live on less than US$ 1 per day. Against these numbers, commercial 
shrink-wrapped office software is often seen as a luxury good. End-user facing 
open source software, like OpenOffice, brings high-quality software to those who 
would otherwise have no other affordable options. Within the ICT for Development 
(ICT4D) community, OpenOffice has long been an important part of achieving 
development goals.

##Support for Linguistic and Cultural Diversity

There are over 6,000 languages in the world, but unless the language is associated 
with a G20 economic superpower, commercial vendors tend to ignore it. The 
OpenOffice community has a long standing tradition of supporting a large number 
of languages, including languages used by smaller populations, minority languages, 
endangered languages, etc.  By supporting languages that would 
not otherwise be supported we help reduce "digital exclusion" and promote 
development, local education and administration.

##Accessibility

Persons with disabilities, especially those with visual impairments, commonly 
rely on "assistive technology" to interact with computers. Such technologies 
work well only when applications are designed and coded to work well with them. 
Additionally, users who create documents must do their part to ensure that the 
documents they create work well with assistive technology, for example through 
the use of image captions, consistent list levels, etc. The OpenOffice project 
aims to provide strong accessibility support, both in the core product and 
including broader ecosystem support via extensions, for working with Braille 
printers, exporting to DAISY talking books, etc.

##Open Standards

Open standards are those standards which are created in an open, transparent 
process, where the specifications can be freely accessed and implemented without 
royalties. Most core web standards are open standards. The default document format 
in OpenOffice, OpenDocument Format (ODF) is also an open standard. Widespread use 
of open standards promotes interoperability and choice in the market. But this 
does not come without effort on our part. We commit to faithful implementation 
of open standards, and to work with standards organizations and other vendors 
to improve these standards and to test and improve interoperability.
