A listed webpage without an menu item is therefore not shown in the menu.

## Website

The websites do not longer use the Apache CMS but the Pelican templating system and the content has been moved from SVN to Git.
- orientation/infrastructure.md
- source.md
- website-local.md - full rewrite
- website-native.md

## Contributions

May need to rewrite descriptions of ICLAs and SGAs better. Also, need to discuss Git and not SVN.
- contributing-code.md
- developer-faqs.md
- pmc-faqs.md

## Mission

Finish the project mission statement.
- mission.md - put into the General menu
- list-conduct.md
